<iostream> : input processing output of data from memory through devices this flow of data is called stream 

        Input Device > Enter data > Memory > Processing> Output Data > Output Device

                 Input stream                Output Stream

                 
for example : we write code (data input) through a input device called keyboard that data go to memory 
        then that data show (data output)through a Output device called Monitor
